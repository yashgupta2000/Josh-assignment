## Sorting Logic

Tasks are sorted by priority first. A custom order is defined for priorities:

High: 1
Medium: 2
Low: 3
The higher the priority, the earlier it appears in the list.

After sorting by priority, tasks are also sorted by their completion status. Completed tasks appear after incomplete ones.
